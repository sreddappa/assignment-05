            <p>Chaat is a popular Indian savory snack available in several variations. It is spicy, tangy and sweet and a popular street food in India. There are various types of chaat food and today I have prepared Samosa Chaat which is one of the popular and most wanted among all.Samosa Chaat is served by adding a plate full of peas or chole masala, mashed samosa with freshly cut veggie toppings and a dash of lemon goodness. You need quiet a bit of ingredients for making this at home and you can find all these ingredients in any Indian store here.</p>
		    <p>I should definitely say that it brings back my childhood days to memory whenever I eat chaat. My dad would never allow me to eat street food so we sneak with our friends to have fun. It is so filling, if I skip my dinner my mom would find out and you know what happens next…:)Samosa chaat is my favorite…Enjoy the homemade chaat!!</p>
