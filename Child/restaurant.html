    <article>      
      <h3>Bastille</h3>
        <p>Ballard Avenue’s Parisian-style brasserie comes alive after dark, when the vintage light fixtures cast the fashionable crowd in a flattering golden hue. The best choices are plats du jour (such as a tender-crisp boneless quail). At brunch, the fluffy omelets and the farmers’ market people-watching (from tables in the cozy, enclosed patio) is top-notch. Brunch Sun., dinner daily. 5307 Ballard Ave. NW; 206.453.5014; bastilleseattle.com</p>

        <h3>Bitterroot</h3> 
        <p>This hip corner spot in Ballard turns out the best barbecue we’ve tasted in Seattle in a long time, especially the ribs and the brisket. Plus brown liquor (the vanilla-scented creamed old fashioned is great) and a choice lineup of local beer. Lunch and dinner daily. 5239 Ballard Ave. NW; 206.588.1577; bitterrootbbq.com</p>

        <h3>Cafe Besalu</h3> 
        <p>The heady scent of butter wafts out of James Miller’s tiny neighborhood bakery each time the door opens, inviting neighbors to come inside. Miller’s croissants, pastries and quiches are nothing short of superb, and the warmth of the windowed storefront space lingers. Breakfast and lunch Wed.–Sun. 5909 24th Ave. NW; 206.789.1463; cafebesalu.com</p>

        <h3>Delancey</h3>
        <p>The humble pizzeria that Brandon Pettit runs with his wife, Molly Wizenberg (creator of food blog Orangette), is such a hit there’s still often an hour’s wait. Pettit’s outstanding pizza has a chewy, salty, smoky crust and bright house-made tomato sauce. Craft cocktail bar Essex is a sparkling addition with</p> 

        <h3>Honoré Artisan Bakery</h3>
        <p>Next door to Delancey is this quaint bakery where the buttery croissants rival Ballard’s other fab bakery, Cafe Besalu. But those caramelized canelés? Those shattering macarons? That kouign amann (a layered sweet-salty pastry from Brittany)? Perfection! Breakfast and lunch Wed.–Sun. 1413 NW 70th St.; 206.706.4035; honorebakery.com</p> 

        <h3>La Carta de Oaxaca</h3>
        <p>Easily Seattle’s most authentic Mexican restaurant, La Carta has a menu that’s eminently craveable. You’ll love the hand-mashed guacamole with house-fried tortilla chips and tender chicken in Oaxaca’s signature sweet, sultry black mole. The tequila/mezcal display is particularly well researched. Lunch Tue.–Sat., dinner Mon.–Sat. 5431 Ballard Ave. NW; 206.782.8722; lacartadeoaxaca.com</p>

        <h3>Paseo</h3> 
        <p>The pink food stand, with outdoor seating only, is hard to miss; see listing under FREMONT for full description. Lunch and dinner Tue.–Sat. 6226 Seaview Ave. NW; 206.789.3100; paseoseattle.com. Cash only.</p> 

        <h3>Ray’s Boathouse & Café</h3> 
        <p>Head to Ray’s upstairs café, where breathtaking sunsets and standard-issue seafood dishes are a Seattle tradition. Downstairs, Ray’s seaside dining room reopened in January after a renovation, and chef Wayne Johnson (formerly of Andaluca) has taken over the kitchen. And then there is that view. On a clear day, the Olympic Mountains fairly jump into your lap. Café lunch and dinner daily; restaurant dinner daily. 6049 Seaview Ave. NW; 206.789.3770; rays.com </p>
